<p>Mules are a genetic hybrid that has been the workhorse for centuries in human society.
A Mule is the product of breeding a male donkey with a female horse. The product of breeding a male horse with
a female donkey (just the opposite) is known as a “hinny.”
Just like you might expect, this hybrid looks like a mixture between a donkey and a horse. Its body is slightly
stouter than an average horse, but leaner than a donkey. Its ears are also slightly longer than those of a horse,
but shorter than those of a donkey.
These creatures typically stand just over 4 ft. tall and weigh about 800 lbs. or so.

Habitat of the Mule
Because they are purely a product of human creation, these creatures do not have a natural habitat. However,
people keep them in a variety of different habitats. You can find them in farms, pastures, grasslands, and
other agricultural areas.EzoicPeople can and have used these large mammals in a variety of different regions
outside of agricultural use as well. We have utilized these hybrids in mountainous regions, deserts, and other arid regions,
and more.
With their tougher skin, they are less likely to overheat compared to a stallion and require less food than a horse, making it easier to forage.
The major challenges faced by them is sickness. Similar diseases such as tetanus, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis, and equine influenza are all
faced by stallions, donkeys, and mules.

Diet
Mules are no different from their parents concerning their diet. They ingest a broad range of grasses and small shrubs.
Another effect of the hybridization of the species is that they only need a fraction of the amount of food that is 
required to feed a stallion, while they maintain the size of a colt. Mule spends most of their day eating or sleeping if 
they aren’t working.

Mules are bred by cross-breeding a mare with a jack, as mentioned above. After a gestational period of about 11 – 12 
months, the mare gives birth to a baby mule, called a foal.
The average mule is about 30 years old, but there have been mules that have lived well into their 40s. Mules are generally 
considered infertile. However,hinneys have had cases of pregnancy.
The primary cause for this infertility is as a result of the different structure and numbers preventing the chromosomes from 
pairing up properly and creating a successful embryo.
Mules and hinnies have 63 chromosomes, while donkeys and horses have 62 and 64 chromosomes respectively. This result in mule’s 
reproductive incompatibility.</p>
